/*Naming Conventions


In programming, it's important to follow naming conventions to keep your code readable and maintainable. However, there are some rules and conventions you should follow when naming things in C++:

Names can contain letters, digits, and underscores.
Names must begin with a letter or an underscore.
Names are case-sensitive (myVariable and myvariable are different).
Names cannot be C++ keywords (like int, float, if, etc.).
In addition to these rules, there are some common naming conventions that developers use to make their code more consistent and readable:

Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., count, totalAmount).
Be descriptive and avoid overly short names (e.g., numberOfStudents is better than n).
Avoid using single-letter variable names, except for simple counters (e.g., i, j, k).
Here are some examples of good and bad variable names:

// Good
int age = 30;
double totalPrice = 150.99;
int numberOfStudents = 25;

// Bad
int a = 30;  // Too short and unclear
double TOTAL_PRICE = 150.99;  // Uppercase is not for regular variables
int n = 25;  // Too short and unclear*/
