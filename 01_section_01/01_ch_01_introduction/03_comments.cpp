/*Comments


In programming, comments are pieces of text that explain what the code is doing. The important thing to know about comments is that they are ignored by the compiler. This means that you can write anything you want inside a comment, and it will not affect your program.

There are two types of comments in C++:

Single-line comments: These comments start with two forward slashes // and continue until the end of the line. For example:
// This is a single-line comment
int x = 5; // This is also a single-line comment
Multi-line comments: These comments start with /* and end with */
/*. They can span multiple lines. For example:
/* This is a
multi-line comment */
/*int y = 10;
Comments are important for making your code understandable to others (and to yourself in the future!). Use them to explain complex logic, describe the purpose of variables, or leave notes about things to improve.*/
