/*Hello World!


The "Hello World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello World! to the screen.

In C++, we use std::cout to print output to the console. The text to be printed is placed within double quotes and followed by the insertion operator <<.

Let's take a look at the "Hello World!" program in C++:

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}

Challenge

Use the code view to write a program that outputs Hello World!

Note that anything inside quotation marks is case sensitive. For example:

std::cout << "Hello World!";
std::cout << "hello world!";
are different things (notice the capital letters in the first line).

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
