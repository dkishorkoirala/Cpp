Did you know that creating a simple calculator in C++ can be a great way to practice what you've learned about variables, operators, and basic input/output? In this project, you'll create a basic calculator app that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It's a practical way to apply your C++ skills and build a useful tool. By the end of this project, you'll have a working calculator that can perform basic math operations! Let's get started!

Challenge

Every good program starts with a welcome message. Output to the screen the following string:

Calculator App
Add endl to the print.
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Calculator App" << endl;
    return 0;
}
